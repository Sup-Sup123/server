	<h2>Introducing FastChat</h2>
	<p>FastChat is a multiplatform chat client that focuses on group communication. We were frusterated at the other cross platform solutions for our simple needs, so we made a better one.</p>
	<p>We focused on <em>speed</em> and <strong>simplicity</strong>, working hard to make a cross platform solution that would beat texting.</p>
